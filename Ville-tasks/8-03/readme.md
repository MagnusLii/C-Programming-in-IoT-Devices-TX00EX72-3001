Write a function that prints given string in Morse code. Use the provided table of symbols. The table contains structures with symbols and their corresponding morse codes. Any white space is printed as two line feeds all other character are printed with morse codes from the table. Morse code is case insensitive (same code for upper and lower case letters). Replace characters that don’t have a Morse code with ‘X’. When you print a morse code from the table print four spaces after the code to make the output more readable.
