Write a function named print_string. Print_string returns number of characters it prints. Print_string takes two parameters: a character pointer (the string to print) and a pointer to a function that takes a char as parameter and returns no value. Print_string must use the function pointer to print the string character by character and it may not modify the string it prints.
