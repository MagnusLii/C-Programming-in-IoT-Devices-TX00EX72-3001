[37]UPON a time, before the faery broods
[49]Drove Nymph and Satyr from the prosperous woods,
[36]Before King Oberon's bright diadem,
[44]Sceptre, and mantle, clasp'd with dewy gem,
[39]Frighted away the Dryads and the Fauns
[52]From rushes green, and brakes, and cowslip'd lawns,
[35]The ever-smitten Hermes empty left
[47]His golden throne, bent warm on amorous theft:
[39]From high Olympus had he stolen light,
[51]On this side of Jove's clouds, to escape the sight
[40]Of his great summoner, and made retreat
[38]Into a forest on the shores of Crete.
[42]For somewhere in that sacred island dwelt
[42]A nymph, to whom all hoofed Satyrs knelt;
[47]At whose white feet the languid Tritons poured
[48]Pearls, while on land they wither'd and adored.
[49]Fast by the springs where she to bathe was wont,
[51]And in those meads where sometime she might haunt,
[45]Were strewn rich gifts, unknown to any Muse,
[47]Though Fancy's casket were unlock'd to choose.
[42]Ah, what a world of love was at her feet!
[40]So Hermes thought, and a celestial heat
[43]Burnt from his winged heels to either ear,
[42]That from a whiteness, as the lily clear,
[41]Blush'd into roses 'mid his golden hair,
[50]Fallen in jealous curls about his shoulders bare.
[47]From vale to vale, from wood to wood, he flew,
[44]Breathing upon the flowers his passion new,
[41]And wound with many a river to its head,
[56]To find where this sweet nymph prepar'd her secret bed:
[49]In vain; the sweet nymph might nowhere be found,
[40]And so he rested, on the lonely ground,
[40]Pensive, and full of painful jealousies
[43]Of the Wood-Gods, and even the very trees.
[46]There as he stood, he heard a mournful voice,
[46]Such as once heard, in gentle heart, destroys
[46]All pain but pity: thus the lone voice spake:
[45]"When from this wreathed tomb shall I awake!
[41]"When move in a sweet body fit for life,
[46]"And love, and pleasure, and the ruddy strife
[40]"Of hearts and lips! Ah, miserable me!"
[38]The God, dove-footed, glided silently
[50]Round bush and tree, soft-brushing, in his speed,
[44]The taller grasses and full-flowering weed,
[36]Until he found a palpitating snake,
[46]Bright, and cirque-couchant in a dusky brake.
[79]Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lore
[79]m Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when 
[79]an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specim
[79]en book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electr
[79]onic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 19
[79]60s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and mo
[79]re recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including ver
[21]sions of Lorem Ipsum.
[79]Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots
[79] in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years
[79] old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virgin
[79]ia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ip
[79]sum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, d
[79]iscovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1
[79].10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Ci
[79]cero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very p
[79]opular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolo
[52]r sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
