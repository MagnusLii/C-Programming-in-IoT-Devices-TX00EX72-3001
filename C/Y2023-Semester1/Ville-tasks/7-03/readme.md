Implement functions text_reader_init and text_reader_read. Text reader_init sets the position to zero and stores the pointer in the context. Text_reader_read takes context pointer, buffer and buffer size as parameters. The function copies characters from the text in context, starting from current position, until a line feed is encountered, end of text is reached or buffer is full. If reading stops at a line feed the line feed is copied into string. Text_reader_read returns the number of characters copied to buffer. When end of text has been reached following reads must return a zero.
